The quiz app is a responsive web application built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript that provides an interactive quiz-taking experience for users to test their knowledge. It has a home page, dynamic section pages for various topics loaded from a JSON file, customizable question components for different question types, and a results page showing final scores. The app implements features like input validation, feedback, ability to revisit questions, randomised questions, persistent score tracking using localStorage, and the option to retry the quiz. It leverages core JavaScript concepts such as variables, control structures, functions, DOM manipulation, events and JSON to provide a smooth multi-section quiz flow and engaging user experience.
